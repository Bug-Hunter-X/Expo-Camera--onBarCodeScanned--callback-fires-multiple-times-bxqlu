This error occurs when using Expo's `Camera` component with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` callback. The callback is triggered multiple times for a single barcode scan, leading to unexpected behavior or data duplication.  This is especially noticeable when scanning barcodes rapidly. The issue stems from a potential race condition in the Expo Camera's barcode scanning logic, where multiple scan events are fired before the component can fully process them. This is not related to the camera's resolution or any particular barcode format. It appears to be a fundamental issue within Expo's `Camera` library's interaction with barcode scanning.
