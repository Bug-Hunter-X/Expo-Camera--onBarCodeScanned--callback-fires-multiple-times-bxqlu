The solution involves using a debounce function to limit the rate at which the `onBarCodeScanned` callback is executed. This prevents multiple invocations from occurring within a short time window.

```javascript
function debounce(func, wait) {
  let timeout;
  return function executedFunction(...args) {
    const later = () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      func(...args);
    };
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
  };
}

// ... rest of the code

const debouncedOnBarCodeScanned = debounce(onBarCodeScanned, 1000); // Debounce with a 1-second delay

<Camera onBarCodeScanned={debouncedOnBarCodeScanned} style={cameraStyle} /> 
```
This updated code uses a debounce function to ensure that the `onBarCodeScanned` callback is only called once per second, effectively resolving the multiple triggers issue.
